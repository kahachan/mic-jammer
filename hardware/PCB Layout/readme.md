# PCB (To Be Designed)

This folder is prepared for the PCB layout files of the Mic Jammer project.  
The PCB design is **not yet created** and will be developed based on the finalized schematic and BOM.

## Planned Specifications
- 2-layer FR4 board
- Thickness: 1.6 mm
- Copper: 1 oz
- Operating voltage: 12V DC
- Core components: Arduino Nano, AD9833, TPA3116D2, IRF4115, Ultrasonic Transducers

## Next Steps
1. Define all component footprints.
2. Create system block diagram.
3. Finalize schematic connection in EasyEDA.
4. Design PCB layout.
5. Generate Gerber and assembly files.
